# Checkers

TODO:

 * simple game; no menu
   * game initializes with fields, some containing pawns
   * player1 
 * 2 players, white pawns top
 * no kings
 * moves and capturing
 * capturing is mandatory
 * game resets after winning
 
 FUTURE PLANS:

 - captured pawns right to the board
 - kings
 - menu
 - player vs AI
 - different difficulty level (capturing varies)
 - different modes (countries)
 - scoreboard
 - saving
 - game displays winner
 - player names
 - score
 
 - [ ] hello
 - [X] its me
